    Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS
  </a>.
</p> 

<p>
  The project in this course simulates a real-given freelancing job. Some client wants a website for
  its product and provides us with the website content. Based on that, I had to plan the design, choose
  the right website personality, fonts, colors, etc., make a prototype, code it out, test it and finally - deploy.
  The Website is fully responsive.

<p><em>
  Omnifood is a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. 
  Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't 
  leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. They want to solve 
  this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use their app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, 
  and their AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But they don't stop there. They partner 
  with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, 
  in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two 
  meals per day, every single day of the month.
